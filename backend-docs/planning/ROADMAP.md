---

## Phase 13 — Public Tenders & Utilities 📋

- [ ] BC Hydro — major utility infrastructure project announcements + tenders
- [ ] FortisBC — major utility projects (often 2-3 year crew deployments)

---

## Phase 14 — Infrastructure & Self-Hosting 🔄

> Full tool options (Docker vs cloud) for embeddings, vector stores, and observability: see [AI_DATA_STRATEGY.md](./AI_DATA_STRATEGY.md).

**Automation (existing):**
- [x] Docker Compose — GroupScout + n8n + Redis
- [x] n8n workflow — trigger `/run` and `/digest` on schedule
- [x] `/n8n/webhook` endpoint — receive external leads from n8n

**Monitoring (existing):**
- [x] Prometheus + Grafana Loki — infrastructure monitoring + log aggregation

**Analytics:**
- [ ] Metabase or Grafana — connect to `groupscout.db` for lead analytics dashboard

**LLM Observability:**
- [ ] Langfuse — track Claude API calls, token costs, prompt versions, hallucinations
  - Cloud: free hobby tier (start here)
  - Docker: `langfuse/langfuse` + Postgres backend (add at Phase 6)

**Embeddings (for RAG):**
- [ ] Ollama (`ollama/ollama`) — local embedding server (`nomic-embed-text`); free, no external API
  - Cloud alternative: Voyage AI `voyage-3-lite` (free 200M tokens/month, best Claude pairing)

**Vector Store (for RAG):**
- [ ] Qdrant (`qdrant/qdrant`) — REST API, Go client, lightweight; replaces in-memory cosine at scale
  - Postgres path: pgvector extension instead (no extra container; preferred if on Phase 6 Postgres)

**Search:**
- [ ] Meilisearch — fast full-text lead search for Admin UI

**Notifications:**
- [ ] Gotify or Apprise — alternative/secondary notification channels

**Error Tracking:**
- [ ] Sentry self-hosted (Docker) — if data privacy becomes a concern

---

## Phase 16 — LLM Provider Abstraction 🔭

> Remove vendor lock-in from `internal/enrichment`. All LLM calls go through a `LLMClient` interface. Provider is config-driven — switch between Claude, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Groq, Mistral, Ollama, or Gemini without touching pipeline code.

- [ ] **Part A** — Interface Extraction: refactor `ClaudeEnricher` to `ClaudeClient` implementing `LLMClient`.
- [ ] **Part B** — OpenAI-Compatible Client: covers OpenAI, Groq, and Mistral.
- [ ] **Part C** — Azure OpenAI Support.
- [ ] **Part D** — Ollama Support: local / Docker, free and private.
- [ ] **Part E** — Fallback & Resilience: primary → secondary on error.
- [ ] **Part F** — Gemini Provider: wire existing `gemini.go` into the factory.

---

## Phase 17 — Airport Disruption Alert System (`alertd`) ✅

> A separate real-time binary (`cmd/alertd/`) that monitors YVR flight disruptions and alerts the hotel team via Slack with actionable revenue ops information. Distinct from the lead pipeline — different cadence, different failure modes.

- [x] **Part A — Data Sources & Weather:** ECCC weather poller, YVR flight scraper, NavCanada NOTAM parser. ✅
- [x] **Part B — Stranded Passenger Score (SPS):** Calculate disruption impact with Vancouver-specific tuning. ✅
- [x] **Part C — Alert Lifecycle State Machine:** `Watch → Alert → Updating → Resolved` transitions; 30-min threshold; Slack `chat.update` with message persistence (TS). ✅
- [x] **Part D — Hotel Config & Binary:** YAML config for property-specific thresholds and contacts. ✅
- [x] **Part E — Inventory Slash Command:** Allow staff to update room counts directly from Slack. ✅

---

## Phase 18 — Contact Enrichment 📋

> Auto-surface a decision-maker contact alongside each lead — project manager, production coordinator, travel manager — using Hunter.io.

- [ ] **18.1** Hunter.io API client for domain lookup and contact ranking.
- [ ] **18.2** Attach contact info to lead during enrichment.
- [ ] **18.3** New migration for contact fields in `leads` table.
- [ ] **18.4** Append contact info block to Slack messages.
- [ ] **18.5** Budget & Size Signals: use project value to estimate spend tiers.

---

## Phase 19 — Slack Actions & Lead Feedback 📋

- [ ] **19.1** Interactive Slack buttons: **Claim** / **Dismiss** / **Snooze**.
- [ ] **19.2** `/slack/actions` endpoint with signing secret verification.
- [ ] **19.3** Lead status transitions and `snoozed_until` persistence.
- [ ] **19.4** Outreach Log: track Won / Lost / No Response outcomes.
- [ ] **19.5** Resurface snoozed leads in weekly digest.

---

## Phase 20 — Analytics & Source Attribution 📋

- [ ] **20.1** Source attribution: hit rate % grouped by data source.
- [ ] **20.2** Forward demand density view: bucket leads by arrival week.
- [ ] **20.3** Weekly analytics summary in Slack digest.

---

## Phase 21 — Multi-Property Support 📋

- [ ] **21.1** Property routing: route leads to different Slack channels based on geography.
- [ ] **21.2** YAML property config (hotel info, segments, thresholds).

---

## Phase 22 — Signal Quality & Repeat Org Detection 📋

- [ ] **22.1** Signal quality scoring per source.
- [ ] **22.2** Repeat organization detection: flag companies that visited in previous years.

---

### AI-Ready SQL + RAG (Postponed)

**Phase A — AI-Ready SQL (SQLite, no new infra, do first):**
- [ ] `migrations/003_ai_context.up.sql` — `v_lead_context` view (denormalized LLM context string)
- [ ] `internal/storage/leads.go` — `GetContext(ctx, id) string` method
- [ ] `internal/enrichment/claude.go` — refactor all `*Prompt()` functions to use `GetContext()` instead of hand-built strings

**Phase B — Embeddings + in-memory RAG:**
- [ ] `migrations/003_ai_context.up.sql` — `lead_embeddings` table (`lead_id`, `model`, `embedding TEXT`, `created_at`)
- [ ] `internal/enrichment/embeddings.go` — `Embedder` interface + `VoyageEmbedder` HTTP impl (free tier)
- [ ] `internal/storage/embeddings.go` — `EmbeddingStore` interface + SQLite impl + Go cosine similarity
- [ ] `config/config.go` — `VoyageAPIKey`, `EmbeddingModel`, `RAGEnabled`, `RAGTopK` (default 3)
- [ ] `internal/enrichment/enricher.go` — generate + save embedding after enrichment; retrieve top-k before Claude call
- [ ] `internal/enrichment/claude.go` — update `permitPrompt()` to accept `[]Lead` similar leads as context param

**Phase C — pgvector (Phase 6 Postgres migration):**
- [ ] `migrations/004_pgvector.up.sql` — `vector(512)` column + ivfflat index on `lead_embeddings`
- [ ] `internal/storage/embeddings.go` — add `PostgresEmbeddingStore` impl using `<=>` cosine operator
- [ ] Wire via `DATABASE_URL` prefix: `postgres://` → pgvector; `*.db` → Go cosine

---

### Near-Term AI Upgrades

- [ ] **Hybrid pre-scorer** — Go rules first (free), then Claude yes/no for borderline 4–6 scores
  - Model: Haiku | Cost: ~10 tokens/call | Catches edge cases rules miss
- [ ] **GC contact enrichment** — for leads with score ≥ 8, Claude + web search tool finds office phone, PM name, LinkedIn page
  - Model: Sonnet + tools | Cost: ~$0.01–0.05/search | Only for high-priority leads
- [ ] **Cross-source deduplication** — Claude semantic check: "Is this the same project as any of these 5 recent leads?"
  - Handles cases where Richmond and Delta both permit the same large project
  - Upgrade path: embedding similarity when lead volume justifies it

### Medium-Term AI Upgrades

- [ ] **News article summarization** — Claude converts raw RSS snippets to leads
  - Flow: headline + 500 chars → yes/no project signal → extract structured fields
- [ ] **Announcement summarizer** — Claude reads BCIB/TransLink/YVR prose press releases
  - Flow: scrape → extract text → Claude 2-sentence summary + value estimate
- [ ] **Multimodal PDF parsing** — pass PDFs directly to Claude (vision) instead of `pdftotext`
  - Benefit: handles any PDF format, no custom parser per city
  - Defer until adding 5+ new cities (currently ~10–50x more expensive)
- [ ] **Lead history & timeline** — link related leads across sources (announcement → permit → award)
  - Tracks project evolution over time; AI or fuzzy match for entity resolution
- [ ] **Sentiment analysis on news** — NLP to flag delays/cancellations and adjust scoring
- [ ] **AI observability** — RAGAS or Vertex Eval to monitor hallucinations + track enrichment quality

### Longer-Term AI Upgrades

- [ ] **Conversational lead query CLI** — `groupscout ask "show all industrial leads last 30 days over $1M"`
  - Claude + function calling; translates NL to DB query + plain-English summary
  - Model: Haiku | Low stakes
- [ ] **Extended thinking for ambiguous scoring** — Sonnet with extended thinking for permits where score is 5–7 AND value > $2M
  - Thinking budget: 2000 tokens | Cost: ~$0.02/call | Only for genuinely unclear cases
- [ ] **Digest personalization** — Claude writes a narrative digest based on current leads + past outreach log
  - Input: leads + outreach history | Output: "3 leads this week. GC from Alberta → prioritize."
- [ ] **Multi-agent pipeline** — one agent per source (parallel), coordinator agent merges + deduplicates + ranks
  - Claude Agent SDK for orchestration | Justified when sources exceed 8–10

### Model Selection Reference

| Use case | Model | Approx. cost/call |
|---|---|---|
| Permit enrichment (bulk) | Haiku | ~$0.001 |
| Ambiguous scoring | Sonnet | ~$0.01 |
| Email drafting | Sonnet | ~$0.01 |
| Complex scoring (extended thinking) | Sonnet + thinking | ~$0.02 |
| Web search enrichment | Sonnet + tools | ~$0.01–0.05 |
| Conversational query | Haiku | ~$0.001 |
| Multimodal PDF parsing | Sonnet (vision) | ~$0.01–0.05 |

### Weekly Cost Estimate (20 permits/week, 5 pass filter)

| Integration | Cost/week |
|---|---|
| Current enrichment (Haiku × 5) | ~$0.005 |
| + Email drafts (Sonnet × 5) | ~$0.05 |
| + Web search for score ≥ 8 leads (×2) | ~$0.10 |
| + News summarization (×20 articles) | ~$0.02 |
| **Total** | **~$0.18/week → ~$9/year** |

## Phase 15 — PostgreSQL + pgvector Migration ✅

> **Why now:** repository pattern already in place; Docker already running; data is tiny; pgvector unlocks RAG.
> **Replaces** the Postgres portion of Phase 6.
> Full atomic tasks: see `PHASES.md` Phase 15.

**Part A — Postgres container + driver:**
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` — add `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` + named volume + health check
- [x] `go.mod` — add `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` (pure Go, no CGO); keep SQLite for local dev fallback
- [x] `config/config.go` — `DriverName()` helper; selects driver from `DATABASE_URL` prefix
- [x] `internal/storage/db.go` — `Open()` routes to pgx or SQLite based on driver
- [x] Verify: connects to Postgres; no migrations yet

**Part B — Schema (Postgres-compatible migrations):**
- [x] `migrations/001_init.postgres.up.sql` — native types: `UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`, `BOOLEAN`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`, `JSONB`
- [x] `internal/storage/db.go` — wire `golang-migrate/migrate` for both drivers
- [x] Verify: migrations run clean; tests pass

**Part C — Storage layer fixes:**
- [x] `internal/storage/leads.go` — remove `boolToInt()`; `?` → `$N` placeholders; native `bool` + `time.Time`
- [x] `internal/storage/raw.go` — `?` → `$N`; `raw_data` writes as JSONB
- [x] Verify: full pipeline end-to-end against Postgres

**Part D — pgvector:**
- [x] `migrations/003_pgvector.up.sql` — `CREATE EXTENSION vector`; `lead_embeddings` with `vector(512)` + ivfflat index
- [x] `internal/storage/embeddings.go` — `PostgresEmbeddingStore` using `<=>` cosine distance
- [x] `internal/enrichment/embeddings.go` — factory: `postgres://` → pgvector; `*.db` → Go cosine
- [x] Verify: similarity search uses index (`EXPLAIN`)

**Part E — Data migration + productionize:**
- [x] `scripts/migrate_to_postgres/main.go` — copy SQLite rows to Postgres in batches
- [x] `.env.example` — update `DATABASE_URL` to Postgres format
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` — app `depends_on` Postgres health check
- [x] `docs/SETUP.md` — update setup instructions
- [x] Verify: `docker compose up` → migrations → full pipeline on Postgres

---

## Phase 17 — Airport Disruption Alert System (`alertd`) ✅

**Goal:** A separate real-time binary (`cmd/alertd/`) that monitors YVR flight disruptions and alerts the hotel team via Slack.

### Part A — Data Acquisition & Weather
- [x] ECCC Weather Poller (`internal/weather/eccc.go`)
- [x] YVR Flight Status Scraper (`internal/aviation/yvr.go`)
- [x] NavCanada NOTAM Parser (`internal/aviation/navcanada.go`)

### Part B — Stranded Passenger Score (SPS)
- [x] SPS formula + Vancouver tuning (`internal/aviation/scorer.go`)

### Part C — Alert Lifecycle State Machine
- [x] State machine: Watch → Alert → Update → Resolve (`internal/alert/lifecycle.go`)
- [x] Slack notification with Block Kit (`internal/alert/slack.go`)

### Part D — Hotel Config & Binary
- [x] Hotel ↔ airport config loader (`config/airports.go`)
- [x] Main poll loop (`cmd/alertd/main.go`)

### Part E — Inventory Slash Command
- [x] `/inventory` Slack command handler

---

## Phase 18 — Contact Enrichment 📋

**Goal:** Auto-surface a decision-maker contact alongside each lead (Phase 18).

---

## Phase 19 — Slack Actions & Lead Feedback 📋

---

## Phase 20 — Analytics & Source Attribution 📋

---

## Phase 21 — Multi-Property Support 📋

---

## Phase 22 — Advanced Intelligence 📋

---

---

## Phase 23 — Agentic Reasoning & Tool-Calling 📋

> Upgrade enrichment from single-call LLM to multi-step reasoning for borderline permits (score 5–7, value > $2M). Claude tool-use for BC Registry lookup + LinkedIn URL generation. See `PHASES.md` Phase 23 for atomic tasks.

- [ ] **Part A** — ReAct loop: second LLM call with tool results injected; activated by `REACT_ENABLED=true`
- [ ] **Part B** — Tool implementations: `internal/tools/bc_registry.go` (OrgBook API, no key) + `internal/tools/linkedin.go` (URL builder, no API)
- [ ] **Part C** — Multimodal PDF enrichment via Claude vision (deferred until 5+ cities)

---

## Phase 24 — AI Observability & Quality 📋

> Track LLM call quality, token costs, and prompt versions. Add AI-Ready SQL view to simplify prompt construction. Structural eval harness to catch bad enrichment outputs before they hit Slack. See `PHASES.md` Phase 24.

- [ ] **Part A** — AI-Ready SQL: `v_lead_context` view + `GetContext()` method; refactor prompt builders
- [ ] **Part B** — Langfuse integration: trace per LLM call (model, tokens, latency, score); noop client when key absent
- [ ] **Part C** — Enrichment eval: `EvalLead()` structural validation + Sentry on hard failures

---

## Phase 25 — Production Deployment & Event-Driven Ingestion 📋

> Deploy the full stack to production. **Hetzner CX32 + Coolify (~$10/month) is the primary recommendation** — it runs both binaries as persistent containers, deploys your existing `docker-compose.yml` directly, and includes n8n/Prometheus/Loki at no extra cost. Railway is the managed-PaaS alternative (~$10–18/month). GCP Cloud Run is **incompatible with `alertd`** (scales to zero; daemon needs persistent compute). See `docs/planning/DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md` for the full analysis.
>
> See `PHASES.md` Phase 25 for atomic tasks.

- [ ] **Part A** — Home server: No-IP/DuckDNS DDNS + port forwarding → Traefik + Let's Encrypt → optional Cloudflare Tunnel; `docs/guides/HOME_DEPLOY.md`
- [ ] **Part B** — Hetzner + Coolify cloud deploy (if uptime SLA matters): VPS provision, Coolify setup, backup config, `docs/guides/COOLIFY.md`
- [ ] **Part C** — Event-driven ingestion: `POST /ingest` + `EnrichOne()` (platform-agnostic)
- [ ] **Part D** — Terraform IaC for GCP (optional; alertd needs Compute Engine VM — Cloud Run won't work)
